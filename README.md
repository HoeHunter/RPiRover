# RPiRover
This project controls the Adafruit Motor HAT from a Raspberry Pi. It is a simple python script, and also uses the RPi Web Camera Interface to be able to control the rover remotely. 

Ensure i2c is enabled, and then run install.sh to install all the necessary software and dependencies. 

Executing rover.sh will run the program.
